# Formulate Pro

Formulate Pro is the ~~paid~~ free package that adds additional functionality to Formulate. Now that we have no plans to upgrade Formulate to work with newer versions of Umbraco, you are free to use Formulate Pro going forward.

Currently, this includes the following:

* **Designed Emails** A form submission handler that facilitates sending designed emails using Razor view files, which you can read about here: [Designed Emails](/pro/designed-emails)
* **Basic Theme** A basic theme to save you the time of styling forms, which you can read about here: [Basic Theme](/pro/basic-theme)

You can read more about Formulate Pro here: [Announcing Formulate Pro](https://code101.net/code-101/announcing-formulate-pro)

You can view the source code here for free: [github.com/Formulate-Pro/Formulate-Pro](https://github.com/Formulate-Pro/Formulate-Pro)

# Installing Formulate Pro

You can install Formulate Pro using NuGet (search for "Formulate.Pro"): [Formulate.Pro](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Formulate.Pro)

Be sure you've already installed the Umbraco 8 and Formulate 3 NuGet packages.

# Paying for Formulate Pro

Formulate Pro is now free, so no payment is required.
